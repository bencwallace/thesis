The central concern of this thesis is the study of critical behaviour in models of
statistical physics in the upper-critical dimension. We study a generalized $n$-component
lattice $|\varphi|^4$ model and a model of weakly self-avoiding walk with nearest-neighbour
contact self-attraction on the Euclidean lattice $\Zd$. By utilizing a supersymmetric integral
representation involving boson and fermion fields, the two models are studied in a unified manner.

Our main result identifies the precise leading-order asymptotics of the two-point function,
susceptibility, and finite-order correlation length of both models in $d = 4$. In
particular, we show that the critical two-point function satisfies mean-field scaling
whereas the near-critical susceptibility and finite-order correlation length exhibit
logarithmic corrections to mean-field behaviour.

The proof employs a renormalisation group method based on a finite-range covariance
decomposition and requires two extensions to this method. The first extension, which
is required for the computation of the finite-order correlation length, is an improvement
of the norms used to control the evolution of the renormalisation group. This allows us to
obtain improved error estimates in the massive regime of the renormalisation group flow.

The second extension involves the identification of critical parameters for models
initialized with a non-zero error coordinate coupled to a marginal/relevant coordinate.
This allows us, for example, to realize the renormalisation group flow of the weakly
self-avoiding walk with self-attraction as a small perturbation of the flow of the
ordinary weakly self-avoiding walk.

% \section*{Examples}
% Chapter~\ref{cha:apple_ref} is based on work conducted in UBC's Maple
% Syrup Laboratory by Dr. A.  Apple, Professor B. Boat, and Michael
% McNeil Forbes. I was responsible for tapping the trees in forests X
% and Z, conducted and supervised all boiling operations, and performed
% frequent quality control tests on the product.

% A version of chapter~\ref{cha:apple_ref} has been
% published~\cite{Apple:2010}. I conducted all the testing and wrote
% most of the manuscript. The section on ``Testing Implements'' was
% originally drafted by Boat, B.  Check the first pages of this
% chapter to see footnotes with similar information.

% Note that this preface must come before the table of contents.  Note
% also that this section ``Examples'' should not be listed in the table
% of contents, so we have used the starred form: \verb|\section*{Example}|.
