\chapter{Preface} % Manditory if any of the conditions are met

You must include a preface if any part of your research was partly or
wholly published in articles, was part of a collaboration, or required
the approval of UBC Research Ethics Boards.

The Preface must include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item A statement indicating the relative contributions of all
  collaborators and co-authors of publications (if any), emphasizing
  details of your contribution, and stating the proportion of research
  and writing conducted by you.
\item A list of any publications arising from work presented in the
  dissertation, and the chapter(s) in which the work is located.
\item The name of the particular UBC Research Ethics Board, and the
  Certificate Number(s) of the Ethics Certificate(s) obtained, if
  ethics approval was required for the research.
\end{itemize}

% %%% Sections and subsections etc. in the Preface should in general
% %%% not be listed in the table of contents, so use the starred form
% %%% of \section etc.
% \section*{Examples}
% Chapter~\ref{cha:apple_ref} is based on work conducted in UBC's Maple
% Syrup Laboratory by Dr. A.  Apple, Professor B. Boat, and Michael
% McNeil Forbes. I was responsible for tapping the trees in forests X
% and Z, conducted and supervised all boiling operations, and performed
% frequent quality control tests on the product.

% A version of chapter~\ref{cha:apple_ref} has been
% published~\cite{Apple:2010}. I conducted all the testing and wrote
% most of the manuscript. The section on ``Testing Implements'' was
% originally drafted by Boat, B.  Check the first pages of this
% chapter to see footnotes with similar information.

% Note that this preface must come before the table of contents.  Note
% also that this section ``Examples'' should not be listed in the table
% of contents, so we have used the starred form: \verb|\section*{Example}|.

\tableofcontents                %% Mandatory
% \listoftables                   %% Mandatory if thesis has tables
\listoffigures                  %% Mandatory if thesis has figures
% \listof{Program}{List of Programs} %% Optional
%% Any other lists should come here, i.e.
%% Abbreviation schemes, definitions, lists of formulae, list of
%% schemes, glossary, list of symbols etc.

\chapter{To do}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Use $\Vcal$, etc. for polynomials, $\Ucal$ for unit vectors

\item
Make $U_{\gcc,\gamma}$ notation consistent with $U_{\gcc,\nu,N}$.
I have done this by getting rid of the latter (it is hardly used
explicitly in clp)

\item
Change $\beta, g$ to $\backslash gcc$

\item
Change $L$ to $\backslash lt$

\item
Make $G_x(g, \nu; n)$ consistent with $G_{\gcc,\gamma,\nu}(a, b)$.
Maybe use $G_x(g, \gamma, \nu)$ and $G_x(g, \nu; n)$

\item
Make it so that $U$ has observables but no constant and $V$ is $U$
plus the constant. Thus, we must change $V$ in saw-sa to $U$ (the $V$
in saw-sa has no observables, but these can be added in without harm).
We must also change $U^\pm$ in saw-sa to something else

\item
Change $\chi$ and $\tilde\chi$ to $\backslash chicCov$ and $\backslash chicCovgen$
\end{itemize}

% Any other unusual prefactory material should come here before the
% main body.
